# JavaRomanNumerals
5 different methods for converting Roman Numerals into Arabic Numerals through Java.

1. The first method is a very simple write-up where it reads the file being given and then converting it into a string token, reading it one by one, and then converting it into an Arabic Numeral. 
Once that's all done, it'll be passed onto a simple GUI. 

2. The second method uses LinkedLists to organize both a sorted and unsorted list of the file, which is turned into a string, then into a string token and then sent through to get organized
or get sent to be converted into an Arabic NUmeral. Again, once all that's done, then it'll be passed onto a GUI for it to be displayed. 

3. The third method uses the same process to organize the file, through LinkedLists, but there's a greater emphasis on the versatility of the GUI itself. The options are expanded with a file menu
handler being used in order to see the original text, unsorted result, sorted result, and an additional option to input your own custom Roman Numeral and see what it is when it's converted. 

4. The fourth method no longer uses LinkedLists, rather, it's much more efficient with the usage of Maps and a comparator to sort and organize all the Roman Numerals and then displaying it in a similar
GUI as the ones before.
